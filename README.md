# SmartKid

SmartKid is a simple Kotlin Android application to help kids learn basic things like ABC and others.
Currently, it has two features which are ABC learning and fruits.
The project has two branches, which are master and dev.

Starting out with open source always seems as a hard thing. I am making it open for [Hacktoberfest 2018](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).
Fork the project and submit a pull request even if it just means documenting.
